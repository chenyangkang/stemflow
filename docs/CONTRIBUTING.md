## Fork the git repository

You will need your own fork to work on the code. Go to the `stemflow` project page and hit the Fork button. You will want to clone your fork to your machine:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USER-NAME/stemflow.git stemflow-YOURNAME
cd stemflow-YOURNAME
git remote add upstream git://github.com/stemflow/stemflow.git
```

This creates the directory `stemflow-YOURNAME` and connects your repository to the upstream (main project) elapid repository.
