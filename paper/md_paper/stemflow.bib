	abstract = {Citizen science projects remain rare in biodiverse yet data-poor countries, contributing to a shortfall in data for biodiversity monitoring and promoting public stewardship of nature. We document and analyse BigMonth2020, a month-long birdwatching event across Java and Bali, publicised through social media and incentivised with grants and competitions. Over 20,000 lists containing 100,000 bird records were submitted to the ‘Burungnesia’ phone application. Spatial coverage extended to 71\% of the islands’ 3408 atlas grid squares (6.9 × 6.9 km), including 1613 previously undocumented squares, with 353 bird species recorded, representing 74\% of Java and Bali’s avifauna excluding vagrants; 27 threatened species were recorded, with new records for 204 grid squares. Almost 25\% of contributors were female, 72\% were under 30 years old, and most were graduates and members of birdwatching clubs. The project cost less than US\$10,000 to run, and serves as a model for rapidly establishing a distributional baseline for monitoring biodiversity trajectories in the tropics.},

The goal is to increase data quantity through participant recruitment and engagement, but also to quantify and control for data quality issues such as observer variability, imperfect detection of species, and both spatial and temporal bias in data collection. Advances at the interface among ecology, statistics, and computer science allow us to create new species distribution models that provide accurate estimates across broad spatial and temporal scales with extremely detailed resolution. eBird data are openly available and used by a broad spectrum of students, teachers, scientists, NGOs, government agencies, land managers, and policy makers. Feedback from this broad data use community helps identify development priorities. As a result, eBird has become a major source of biodiversity data, increasing our knowledge of the dynamics of species distributions, and having a direct impact on the conservation of birds and their habitats.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clariﬁed how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reﬂect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual uniﬁcation across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a ﬁxed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on ﬂows of energy and matter. These ﬁndings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

                  Large‐scale monitoring of seasonal animal movement is integral to science, conservation and outreach. However, gathering representative movement data across entire species ranges is frequently intractable. Citizen science databases collect millions of animal observations throughout the year, but it is challenging to infer individual movement behaviour solely from observational data.
                
                
                  
                    We present
                    BirdFlow
                    , a probabilistic modelling framework that draws on citizen science data from the eBird database to model the population flows of migratory birds. We apply the model to 11 species of North American birds, using GPS and satellite tracking data to tune and evaluate model performance.
                  
                
                
                  
                    We show that
                    BirdFlow
                    models can accurately infer individual seasonal movement behaviour directly from eBird relative abundance estimates. Supplementing the model with a sample of tracking data from wild birds improves performance.
                  
                
                
                  
                    Researchers can extract a number of behavioural inferences from model results, including migration routes, timing, connectivity and forecasts. The

Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study ofecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range ofscales will have unique causes and biological consequences.},

	abstract = {Predicting the occurrence of rare species is challenging, especially outside of their known ranges. However, this information is critical for assessing conservation status, guiding monitoring efforts, and directing conservation actions for species threatened with extinction. Furthermore, frequent updates are needed under changing climate and landscape and thus, shifting species' distribution. Data collected by community science projects may provide additional information about species occurrence, complementing standard surveys. We used data from a com­ munity science project, eBird, and species-specific environmental variables with Bayesian Networks (BNs) to predict the occurrence of 12 federally-protected birds in Canada outside archived known ranges. Our results indicate the number of presence records in the eBird database in the previous three years is a useful variable to include in models predicting species occurrence outside known ranges for 7 out of 12 species. Land cover var­ iables were important predictors, but the distance between a given site and the known range of species was not. While low number and proportion of detections in input datasets were negatively correlated with model per­ formance, our BNs correctly predicted more than half of the presences in independent datasets for 6 species. For these 6 species, BNs predicted additional 0.07 to 68.22\% (mean 20.93\%) area of occurrence beyond known ranges. This study suggests that community science data may help to fill some information gaps in standard surveys and could be used to update species occurrence information for rare species, particularly in combination with models (e.g., BNs) capable of making and updating predictions with limited data.},

Here, we uncover stark disparities in spatiotemporal variation between avian taxonomic diversity (TD) and functional diversity (FD) across the continental US. We show that the seasonality of species richness expectedly3 follows a latitudinal gradient, whereas seasonality of FD instead manifests a distinct east-west gradient. In the eastern US, the temporal patterns of TD and FD are diametrically opposed. In winter, functional richness is highest despite seasonal species loss, and the remaining most abundant species are amassed in fewer regions of the functional space relative to the rest of the year, likely reﬂecting decreased resource availability. In contrast, temporal signatures for TD and FD are more congruent in the western US. There, both species and functional richness peak during the breeding season, and species’ abundances are more regularly distributed and widely spread across the functional space than during winter. Our results suggest that migratory birds in the western US disproportionately contribute to avian FD by possessing more unique trait characteristics than resident birds,4,5 while the primary contribution of migrants in the eastern US is through increasing the regularity of abundances within the functional space relative to the rest of the year. We anticipate that the uncovered complexity of spatiotemporal associations among measures of avian diversity will be the catalyst for adopting an explicitly temporal framework for multi-faceted biodiversity analysis.},

                  Count data are ubiquitous in ecology and the Poisson generalized linear model (GLM) is commonly used to model the association between counts and explanatory variables of interest. When fitting this model to the data, one typically proceeds by first confirming that the model assumptions are satisfied. If the residuals appear to be overdispersed or if there is zero‐inflation, key assumptions of the Poison GLM may be violated and researchers will then typically consider alternatives to the Poison GLM. An important question is whether the potential model selection bias introduced by this data‐driven multi‐stage procedure merits concern.
                
                
                  Here we conduct a large‐scale simulation study to investigate the potential consequences of model selection bias that can arise in the simple scenario of analysing a sample of potentially overdispersed, potentially zero‐inflated, count data. Specifically, we investigate model selection procedures recently recommended by Blasco‐Moreno et al. (2019) using either a series of score tests or information theoretic criteria to select the best model.
                
                
                  We find that, when sample sizes are small, model selection based on preliminary score tests (or information theoretic criteria, e.g. AIC, BIC) can lead to potentially substantial inflation of false positive rates (i.e. type 1 error inflation). When sample sizes are sufficiently large, model selection based on preliminary score tests, is not problematic.
                
                
                  Ignoring the possibility of overdispersion and zero‐inflation during data analyses can lead to invalid inference. However, if one does not have sufficient power to test for overdispersion and zero‐inflation, post hoc model selection may also lead to substantial bias. This ‘catch‐22’ suggests that, if sample sizes are small, a healthy skepticism is warranted whenever one rejects the null hypothesis of no association between a given outcome and covariate.},

Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged SDMs in the context of multispecies data, including both joint SDMs that model multiple species together, and stacked SDMs that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these SDM approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.},

                Geostatistical data—spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon— are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models (GLMMs) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.
              
              
                Here, we introduce the R package sdmTMB, which implements predictive-process SPDE- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder (TMB) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package’s use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.
              
              
                
                  We highlight advantages of using sdmTMB for this class of models: (1) sdmTMB provides a flexible interface familiar to users of
                  glm()
                  , lme4, glmmTMB, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) sdmTMB provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) sdmTMB includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).
                
              
              
                We hope that sdmTMB’s user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

In theory, SDMs capture (at least part of) species' ecological niches and can be used to make inferences about the distribution of suitable habitat for species of interest. Because habitat suitability is expected to influence population demography, SDMs have been used to estimate a variety of population parameters, from occurrence to genetic diversity. However, a critical look at the ability of SDMs to predict independent data across different aspects of population biology is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature, retrieving 201 studies that tested predictions from SDMs against independent assessments of occurrence, abundance, population performance, and genetic diversity. Although there is some support for the ability of SDMs to predict occurrence ({\textasciitilde}53\% of studies depending on how support was assessed), the predictive performance of these models declines progressively from occurrence to abundance, to population mean fitness, to genetic diversity. At the same time, we observed higher success among studies that evaluated performance for single versus multiple species, pointing to a possible publication bias. Thus, the limited accuracy of SDMs reported here may reflect the best‐case scenario. We discuss the limitations of these models and provide specific recommendations for their use for different applications going forward. However, we emphasize that predictions from SDMs, especially when used to inform conservation decisions, should be treated as hypotheses to be tested with independent data rather than as stand‐ins for the population parameters we seek to know.},

Motivated by a dynamic land conservation program, we develop and assess a general method for modeling relative abundance using citizen science monitoring data. Weekly estimates of relative abundance and occurrence were compared for prioritizing times and locations of conservation actions for migratory waterbird species in California, USA. We found that abundance estimates consistently provided better rankings of observed counts than occurrence estimates. Additionally, the relationship between abundance and occurrence was nonlinear and varied by species and season. Across species, locations prioritized by occurrence models had only 10–58\% overlap with locations prioritized by abundance models, highlighting that occurrence models will not typically identify the locations of highest abundance that are vital for conservation of populations.},
