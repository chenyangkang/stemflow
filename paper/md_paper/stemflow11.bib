The unique beneﬁt for the ﬁeld of ecology lies in understanding processes occurring at broad geographic scales and on private lands, which are impossible to sample extensively with traditional ﬁeld research models. Citizen science produces large, longitudinal data sets, whose potential for error and bias is poorly understood. Because it does not usually aim to uncover mechanisms underlying ecological patterns, citizen science is best viewed as complementary to more localized, hypothesis-driven research. In the process of addressing the impacts of current, global “experiments” altering habitat and climate, large-scale citizen science has led to new, quantitative approaches to emerging questions about the distribution and abundance of organisms across space and time.},

Over 20,000 lists containing 100,000 bird records were submitted to the ‘Burungnesia’ phone application. Spatial coverage extended to 71\% of the islands’ 3408 atlas grid squares (6.9 × 6.9 km), including 1613 previously undocumented squares, with 353 bird species recorded, representing 74\% of Java and Bali’s avifauna excluding vagrants; 27 threatened species were recorded, with new records for 204 grid squares. Almost 25\% of contributors were female, 72\% were under 30 years old, and most were graduates and members of birdwatching clubs. The project cost less than {US}\$10,000 to run, and serves as a model for rapidly establishing a distributional baseline for monitoring biodiversity trajectories in the tropics.},

In this paper we propose a general class of models we call {AdaSTEM}, for Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Exploratory Models, that are able to exploit variation in the density of observations while adapting to multiple scales in space and time. We show that this framework is able to efﬁciently discover multiscale structure when it is present, while retaining predictive performance when absent. We provide an empirical comparison and analysis, offer theoretical insights from the ensemble loss decomposition, and deploy {AdaSTEM} to estimate the spatiotemporal distribution of Barn Swallow (Hirundo rustica) across the Western Hemisphere using massively crowdsourced {eBird} data.},

	abstract = {Information on species’ distributions, abundances, and how they change over time is central to the study of the ecology and conservation of animal populations. This information is challenging to obtain at landscape scales across range-wide extents for two main reasons. First, landscape-scale processes that affect populations vary throughout the year and across species’ ranges, requiring high-resolution, year-round data across broad, sometimes hemispheric, spatial extents. Second, while citizen science projects can collect data at these resolutions and extents, using these data requires appropriate analysis to address known sources of bias. Here, we present an analytical framework to address these challenges and generate year-round, range-wide distributional information using citizen science data. To illustrate this approach, we apply the framework to Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), a long-distance Neotropical migrant and species of conservation concern, using data from the citizen science project {eBird}. We estimate occurrence and abundance across a range of spatial scales throughout the annual cycle. Additionally, we generate intra-annual estimates of the range, intraannual estimates of the associations between species and characteristics of the landscape, and interannual trends in abundance for breeding and non-breeding seasons. The range-wide population trajectories for Wood Thrush show a close correspondence between breeding and nonbreeding seasons with steep declines between 2010 and 2013 followed by shallower rates of decline from 2013 to 2016. The breeding season range-wide population trajectory based on the independently collected and analyzed North American Breeding Bird Survey data also shows this pattern. The information provided here fills important knowledge gaps for Wood Thrush, especially during the less studied migration and non-breeding periods. More generally, the modeling framework presented here can be used to accurately capture landscape scale intra- and interannual distributional dynamics for broadly distributed, highly mobile species.},

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, major advances have clariﬁed how ecological patterns inform theory, and how in turn theory informs applied ecology. Also, there has been an increased recognition that the problem of scale at which ecological processes should be considered is critical if we are to produce general predictions. Ecological dynamics is always stochastic at small scales, but variability is conditional on the scale of description. The radical changes in the scope and aims of ecology over the past decades reﬂect in part the need to address pressing societal issues of environmental change. Technological advances in molecular biology, global positioning, sensing instrumentation and computational power should not be overlooked as an explanation for these radical changes. However, I argue that conceptual uniﬁcation across ecology, genetics, evolution and physiology has fostered even more fertile questions. We are moving away from the view that evolution is played in a ﬁxed ecological theatre: the theatre is being rapidly and relentlessly redesigned by the players themselves. The maintenance of ecosystem functions depends on shifts in species assemblages and on cellular metabolism, not only on ﬂows of energy and matter. These ﬁndings have far reaching implications for our understanding of how ecosystem function and biodiversity will withstand (or not) environmental changes in the 21st century.},

                  Large‐scale monitoring of seasonal animal movement is integral to science, conservation and outreach. However, gathering representative movement data across entire species ranges is frequently intractable. Citizen science databases collect millions of animal observations throughout the year, but it is challenging to infer individual movement behaviour solely from observational data.

                    , a probabilistic modelling framework that draws on citizen science data from the {eBird} database to model the population flows of migratory birds. We apply the model to 11 species of North American birds, using {GPS} and satellite tracking data to tune and evaluate model performance.




                    We show that
                    {BirdFlow}
                    models can accurately infer individual seasonal movement behaviour directly from {eBird} relative abundance estimates. Supplementing the model with a sample of tracking data from wild birds improves performance.




                    Researchers can extract a number of behavioural inferences from model results, including migration routes, timing, connectivity and forecasts. The
                    {BirdFlow}
                    framework has the potential to advance migration ecology research, boost insights gained from direct tracking studies and serve a number of applied functions in conservation, disease surveillance, aviation and public outreach.},

	abstract = {Artificial light at night ({ALAN}) is adversely affecting natural systems worldwide, including the disorienting influence of {ALAN} on nocturnally migrating birds. Understanding how {ALAN} trends are developing across species’ seasonal distributions will inform mitigation efforts, such as Lights Out programs. Here, we intersect {ALAN} annual trend estimates (1992–2013) with weekly estimates of relative abundance for 42 nocturnally migrating passerine bird species that breed in North America using observations from the {eBird} community science database for the combined period 2005–2020. We use a cluster analysis to identify species with similar weekly associations with {ALAN} trends. Our results identified three prominent clusters. Two contained species that occurred in northeastern and western North America during the breeding season. These species were associated with moderate {ALAN} levels and weak negative {ALAN} trends during the breeding season, and low {ALAN} levels and strong positive {ALAN} trends during the nonbreeding season. The difference between the breeding and nonbreeding seasons was lower for species that occurred in northern South America and greater for species that occurred in Central America during the nonbreeding season. For species that occurred in South America during the nonbreeding season, positive {ALAN} trends increased in strength as species migrated through Central America, especially in the spring. The third cluster contained species whose associations with positive {ALAN} trends remained high across the annual cycle, peaking during migration, especially in the spring. These species occurred in southeastern North America during the breeding season where they were associated with high {ALAN} levels, and in northern South America during the nonbreeding season where they were associated with low {ALAN} levels. Our findings suggest reversing {ALAN} trends in Central America during migration, especially in the spring, would benefit the most individuals of the greatest number of species. Reversing {ALAN} trends in southeastern North America during the breeding season and Central America during the nonbreeding season would generate the greatest benefits outside of migration.},

Applied challenges, such as the prediction of the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change, require the interfacing of phenomena that occur on very different scales of space, time, and ecological organization. Furthermore, there is no single natural scale at which ecological phenomena should be studied; systems generally show characteristic variability on a range of spatial, temporal, and organizational scales. The observer imposes a perceptual bias, a filter through which the system is viewed. This has fundamental evolutionary significance, since every organism is an "observer" of the environment, and life history adaptations such as dispersal and dormancy alter the perceptual scales of the species, and the observed variability. It likewise has fundamental significance for our own study ofecological systems, since the patterns that are unique to any range ofscales will have unique causes and biological consequences.},

This perception likely stems from the propensity of data generated by {CS} to contain greater levels of variability (e.g., measurement error) or bias (e.g., spatio-temporal clustering) in comparison to data collected by scientists or instruments. Modern analytical approaches can account for many types of error and bias typical of {CS} datasets. It is possible to (1) describe how pseudo-replication in sampling inﬂuences the overall variability in response data using mixed-effects modeling, (2) integrate data to explicitly model the sampling process and account for bias using a hierarchical modeling framework, and (3) examine the relative inﬂuence of many different or related explanatory factors using machine learning tools. Information from these modeling approaches can be used to predict species distributions and to estimate biodiversity. Even so, achieving the full potential from {CS} projects requires meta-data describing the sampling process, reference data to allow for standardization, and insightful modeling suitable to the question of interest.},

However, this information is critical for assessing conservation status, guiding monitoring efforts, and directing conservation actions for species threatened with extinction. Furthermore, frequent updates are needed under changing climate and landscape and thus, shifting species' distribution. Data collected by community science projects may provide additional information about species occurrence, complementing standard surveys. We used data from a com­ munity science project, {eBird}, and species-specific environmental variables with Bayesian Networks ({BNs}) to predict the occurrence of 12 federally-protected birds in Canada outside archived known ranges. Our results indicate the number of presence records in the {eBird} database in the previous three years is a useful variable to include in models predicting species occurrence outside known ranges for 7 out of 12 species. Land cover var­ iables were important predictors, but the distance between a given site and the known range of species was not. While low number and proportion of detections in input datasets were negatively correlated with model per­ formance, our {BNs} correctly predicted more than half of the presences in independent datasets for 6 species. For these 6 species, {BNs} predicted additional 0.07 to 68.22\% (mean 20.93\%) area of occurrence beyond known ranges. This study suggests that community science data may help to fill some information gaps in standard surveys and could be used to update species occurrence information for rare species, particularly in combination with models (e.g., {BNs}) capable of making and updating predictions with limited data.},

Here, we uncover stark disparities in spatiotemporal variation between avian taxonomic diversity ({TD}) and functional diversity ({FD}) across the continental {US}. We show that the seasonality of species richness expectedly3 follows a latitudinal gradient, whereas seasonality of {FD} instead manifests a distinct east-west gradient. In the eastern {US}, the temporal patterns of {TD} and {FD} are diametrically opposed. In winter, functional richness is highest despite seasonal species loss, and the remaining most abundant species are amassed in fewer regions of the functional space relative to the rest of the year, likely reﬂecting decreased resource availability. In contrast, temporal signatures for {TD} and {FD} are more congruent in the western {US}. There, both species and functional richness peak during the breeding season, and species’ abundances are more regularly distributed and widely spread across the functional space than during winter. Our results suggest that migratory birds in the western {US} disproportionately contribute to avian {FD} by possessing more unique trait characteristics than resident birds,4,5 while the primary contribution of migrants in the eastern {US} is through increasing the regularity of abundances within the functional space relative to the rest of the year.

                  Count data are ubiquitous in ecology and the Poisson generalized linear model ({GLM}) is commonly used to model the association between counts and explanatory variables of interest. When fitting this model to the data, one typically proceeds by first confirming that the model assumptions are satisfied. If the residuals appear to be overdispersed or if there is zero‐inflation, key assumptions of the Poison {GLM} may be violated and researchers will then typically consider alternatives to the Poison {GLM}. An important question is whether the potential model selection bias introduced by this data‐driven multi‐stage procedure merits concern.


                  Here we conduct a large‐scale simulation study to investigate the potential consequences of model selection bias that can arise in the simple scenario of analysing a sample of potentially overdispersed, potentially zero‐inflated, count data. Specifically, we investigate model selection procedures recently recommended by Blasco‐Moreno et al. (2019) using either a series of score tests or information theoretic criteria to select the best model.


                  We find that, when sample sizes are small, model selection based on preliminary score tests (or information theoretic criteria, e.g. {AIC}, {BIC}) can lead to potentially substantial inflation of false positive rates (i.e. type 1 error inflation). When sample sizes are sufficiently large, model selection based on preliminary score tests, is not problematic.


                  Ignoring the possibility of overdispersion and zero‐inflation during data analyses can lead to invalid inference. However, if one does not have sufficient power to test for overdispersion and zero‐inflation, post hoc model selection may also lead to substantial bias. This ‘catch‐22’ suggests that, if sample sizes are small, a healthy skepticism is warranted whenever one rejects the null hypothesis of no association between a given outcome and covariate.},

Given the wealth of existing models, it is unclear which models perform best for interpolation or extrapolation of existing data sets, particularly when one is concerned with species assemblages. We compared the predictive performance of 33 variants of 15 widely applied and recently emerged {SDMs} in the context of multispecies data, including both joint {SDMs} that model multiple species together, and stacked {SDMs} that model each species individually combining the predictions afterward. We offer a comprehensive evaluation of these {SDM} approaches by examining their performance in predicting withheld empirical validation data of different sizes representing five different taxonomic groups, and for prediction tasks related to both interpolation and extrapolation. We measure predictive performance by 12 measures of accuracy, discrimination power, calibration, and precision of predictions, for the biological levels of species occurrence, species richness, and community composition. Our results show large variation among the models in their predictive performance, especially for communities comprising many species that are rare. The results do not reveal any major trade-offs among measures of model performance; the same models performed generally well in terms of accuracy, discrimination, and calibration, and for the biological levels of individual species, species richness, and community composition. In contrast, the models that gave the most precise predictions were not well calibrated, suggesting that poorly performing models can make overconfident predictions. However, none of the models performed well for all prediction tasks. As a general strategy, we therefore propose that researchers fit a small set of models showing complementary performance, and then apply a cross-validation procedure involving separate data to establish which of these models performs best for the goal of the study.},

                  Species distribution models ({SDM}) are widely applied to understand changing species geographical distribution and abundance patterns. However, existing {SDM} tools are inherently static and inadequate for modelling species distributions that are driven by dynamic environmental conditions.




                      {dynamicSDM}

                    provides novel tools that explicitly consider the temporal dimension at key {SDM} stages, including functions for: (a) Cleaning and filtering species occurrence records by spatial and temporal qualities; (b) Generating pseudo‐absence records through space and time; (c) Extracting spatiotemporally buffered explanatory variables; (d) Fitting {SDMs} whilst accounting for temporal biases and autocorrelation and (e) Projecting intra‐ and inter‐ annual geographical distributions and abundances at high spatiotemporal resolution.




                    Package functions have been designed to be: flexible for targeting specific study species; compatible with other {SDM} tools; and, by utilising Google Earth Engine and Google Drive, to have low computing power and storage needs. We illustrate

                Geostatistical data—spatially referenced observations related to some continuous spatial phenomenon— are ubiquitous in ecology and can reveal ecological processes and inform management decisions. However, appropriate models to analyze these data, such as generalized linear mixed effects models ({GLMMs}) with Gaussian random fields, are often computationally intensive and challenging to implement, interpret, and evaluate.


                Here, we introduce the R package {sdmTMB}, which implements predictive-process {SPDE}- (stochastic partial differential equation) based spatial and spatiotemporal models. Estimation is conducted via maximum marginal likelihood with Template Model Builder ({TMB}) but can be extended to penalized likelihood or Bayesian inference. We describe the statistical model, illustrate the package’s use through two case studies, and compare the functionality, speed, and interface to related software.



                  We highlight advantages of using {sdmTMB} for this class of models: (1) {sdmTMB} provides a flexible interface familiar to users of
                  glm()
                  , lme4, {glmmTMB}, or mgcv; (2) estimation is often faster than alternatives; (3) {sdmTMB} provides simple out-of-sample cross validation; (4) non-stationary processes (time-varying and spatially varying coefficients) are easily constructed with a formula interface; and (5) {sdmTMB} includes features not available as a combination in related packages (e.g., delta/hurdle models, penalized smoothers and break-point effects, anisotropy, abundance index standardization).



                We hope that {sdmTMB}’s user-friendly interface will open this useful class of models to a wider audience within species distribution modelling and beyond.},

	abstract = {Species distribution models ({SDMs}) are widely used in ecology. In theory, {SDMs} capture (at least part of) species' ecological niches and can be used to make inferences about the distribution of suitable habitat for species of interest. Because habitat suitability is expected to influence population demography, {SDMs} have been used to estimate a variety of population parameters, from occurrence to genetic diversity. However, a critical look at the ability of {SDMs} to predict independent data across different aspects of population biology is lacking. Here, we systematically reviewed the literature, retrieving 201 studies that tested predictions from {SDMs} against independent assessments of occurrence, abundance, population performance, and genetic diversity. Although there is some support for the ability of {SDMs} to predict occurrence ({\textasciitilde}53\% of studies depending on how support was assessed), the predictive performance of these models declines progressively from occurrence to abundance, to population mean fitness, to genetic diversity. At the same time, we observed higher success among studies that evaluated performance for single versus multiple species, pointing to a possible publication bias. Thus, the limited accuracy of {SDMs} reported here may reflect the best‐case scenario. We discuss the limitations of these models and provide specific recommendations for their use for different applications going forward. However, we emphasize that predictions from {SDMs}, especially when used to inform conservation decisions, should be treated as hypotheses to be tested with independent data rather than as stand‐ins for the population parameters we seek to know.},

One widely used platform, {iNaturalist}, provides millions of digitally vouchered observations submitted by a global user base. These observation records include a date and a location but otherwise do not contain any information about the sampling process. As a result, sampling biases must be inferred from the data themselves. In the present article, we examine spatial and temporal biases in {iNaturalist} observations from the platform’s launch in 2008 through the end of 2019. We also characterize user behavior on the platform in terms of individual activity level and taxonomic specialization. We found that, at the level of taxonomic class, the users typically specialized on a particular group, especially plants or insects, and rarely made observations of the same species twice. Biodiversity scientists should consider whether user behavior results in systematic biases in their analyses before using {iNaturalist} data.},

	abstract = {Conservation prioritization requires knowledge about organism distribution and density. This information is often inferred from models that estimate the probability of species occurrence rather than from models that estimate species abundance, because abundance data are harder to obtain and model. However, occurrence and abundance may not display similar patterns and therefore development of robust, scalable, abundance models is critical to ensuring that scarce conservation resources are applied where they can have the greatest beneﬁts. Motivated by a dynamic land conservation program, we develop and assess a general method for modeling relative abundance using citizen science monitoring data. Weekly estimates of relative abundance and occurrence were compared for prioritizing times and locations of conservation actions for migratory waterbird species in California, {USA}. We found that abundance estimates consistently provided better rankings of observed counts than occurrence estimates. Additionally, the relationship between abundance and occurrence was nonlinear and varied by species and season. Across species, locations prioritized by occurrence models had only 10–58\% overlap with locations prioritized by abundance models, highlighting that occurrence models will not typically identify the locations of highest abundance that are vital for conservation of populations.},
